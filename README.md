# mb-closest-blip

Here is a small script for showing the closest blip in FiveM.

This scirpt calculates your distance from the blip coords and activate the one closest to you.

No dependencies. (Easy to add QBcore or any other framework to show notifs.)

Similar logic implemented from LegacyFuel closest gas station blips.

You can go to Config and modify the blips as you wish.
